# LASU Campus Navigation System

A modern web-based campus navigation platform developed for **Lagos State University (LASU), Ojo Campus**.

The system enables students, staff, and visitors to quickly locate campus facilities, search for departments and offices, receive intelligent route guidance, and navigate the campus using an interactive digital map.

Built with modern web technologies, the application combines interactive mapping, shortest-path algorithms, GPS tracking, real-time Firestore synchronization, and a rule-based campus assistant to provide a seamless navigation experience.
